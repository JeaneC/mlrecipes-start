The content in this repository is from the GoogleDev series on [Machine Learning Recipes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKxRvEZd3Mw&list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIuiBfYad6rFYQU_jL2ryal) by Josh Gordon.

__I made a Jupyter Notebook for each video__
- Video notes are included for each one
- Recipes and comments included as well

__Note:__ Since GitHub supports ipynb display, you can view the documents by just clicking on them in this GitHub folder online. No need to download and open in jupyter notebook.
